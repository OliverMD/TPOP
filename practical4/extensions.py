"""
Sparse matrix representation:
List of lists of numbers:
Each inner list represents a vector of the matrix.
But since most of the matrix is 0s, 0s are assumed in all spaces
0  0
1  0

The first column is encoded as:
[1,1,0]
Second Column:
[2]
[0,n,0,n,0]

Always starts with the number of 0s and ends with the number of 0s
even if 0.
